Theaters are expecting difficulties in coming back from coronavirus-related 
restrictions and closures.
As businesses begin to open around the world, the path forward for theater is unclear. 
This is especially true for large-scale musicals and dramas.
Live theater, with its high costs and large numbers of people, may not be the 
same for some time, producers and actors say.
Mary McColl is the executive director of the actors’ labor union Equity in the United States.
Speaking with the Reuters news agency, she described the health concerns of doing live theater.
“When we cry, there are tears, sometimes our noses run. Sometimes when we sing 
or are yelling, we spit and that lands on other actors, or it might land on the 
orchestra pit. And we are doing that eight times a week,” she said.
New York City’s Broadway theaters closed in the middle of March. 
London’s West End theaters followed a few days later. Almost no one expects them 
to reopen when the current closure period ends on June 7 and June 28, respectively.
Jessica Koravos is president of Andrew Lloyd Webber’s Really Useful Group.
“We are very tied to social distancing measures,” she said. “As long as they are 
still in place, a mainstream return to theater and musical theater, in particular, 
looks pretty impossible.”
In April, a Reuters/Ipsos poll found that only 27 percent of those questioned 
would go to a theater performance when theaters reopen. Some 51 percent said live 
theater should not return at all before a vaccine for the novel coronavirus is available.
However, the theater world wants to get going before then.
The U.S. office of Equity has asked a disease control expert to develop 
guidelines for actors and other people who work on plays.
In addition, people are thinking about what kinds of plays would work best for 
taking theatrical productions out of traditional spaces.
Brian Moreland is producer of the upcoming Broadway shows “American Buffalo” and “Blue.”
“I don’t think theater will go away. I just think it will be different when it comes back,” he said.
Theaters may be dark, but online rehearsals are continuing.
Broadway producer and investor Brisa Trinchero is hopeful.
She said writers are working on new kinds of theater productions and 
some companies are looking to do one-person shows.
“We are an industry of creative people,” she said.
Trinchero added that there would likely be an increase in “smaller performance pieces, cabaret” 
and what she called more intimate things.
Musicals are likely to be the last to come back. Musicals have large casts and crews. 
They are also more costly.
Shows with one or two actors might work for some. So might a plan to limit 
theaters to 50 percent capacity.
But for big musicals, “it wouldn’t be possible commercially to survive on 
those audience levels,” said Koravos.
Even with many issues to resolve, the theatre community is more hopeful 
than a month ago. It believes that the coronavirus-related restrictions have showed 
the value of human connection and live performances.
“People are now talking about what it looks like on the other side and 
three to four weeks ago we weren’t prepared to have this conversation,” Moreland said. 
“So that makes me very hopeful.”
