Babies have been a popular subject on social media in recent days.
People are writing a lot on Twitter and other social media platforms 
about the impending birth of the first child of Britain’s Prince Harry and 
Meghan Markel, the Duchess of Sussex.
She and her husband, married in 2018, have been keeping many details about the baby's birth secret. 
They say they do not know the baby's sex and have not told the public where the baby will be born.
The secrecy around the birth has been a hot issue on social media. Writer Tina Brown 
noted that she supports Meghan Markel's decision to keep details of the baby's birth 
private – a decision that breaks from what Britain’s royal family has done in the past.
"I think Meghan is totally entitled to do things differently," she wrote.
American broadcaster Kasie Hunt wrote that she supports the Duchess of Sussex. 
In a Tweet, she added that Meghan Markle's critics can "#getoffmylawn."
This is a term an older adult might use to chastise young people for doing 
something they are not supposed to do.
Many media organizations have released or published stories about where the baby 
will be in the royal succession line. 
The television program “Good Morning America” noted that the baby will be seventh 
in line for the throne.
The Evening Standard, a British publication, noted that the secrecy surrounding 
the birth has created a situation for some people to gamble. Specifically, they are making 
predictions about the sex and name of the baby, which bookmakers expect to be a girl.
Many believe that Grace, Diana, or Elizabeth will be the name if the baby is a girl.
If it is a boy, many suspect the name will be Albert, Arthur, or James.
